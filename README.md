# Auto_Seller

I have recently started using Figma and SCSS, these two tools I want to use in my project.
The main objective of this site is to demonstrate my knowledge of these technologies. 
The Site Auto Seller is an online car dealership. It has the latest cars, with different car sectors: SUV, Sedan, etc.
I have made it user-friendly by keeping it up to standard with other car retailers, but I have also added my personal touch to give it my flair.
