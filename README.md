# Auto_Seller

The Site Auto Seller is an online car dealership. It has the latest cars, with different car sectors: SUV, Sedan, etc.
I have made it user-friendly by keeping it up to standard with other car retailers, but I have also added my personal touch to give it my flair.

I have added Bootstrap to make the site more responsive and attractive.

The languages and frameworks used in this project are JavaScript, SCSS and Bootstrap. This site is mobile friendly and the link to the site can be found here: https://auto-seller.vercel.app/
