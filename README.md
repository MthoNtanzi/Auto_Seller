# Auto_Seller

I have recently started using Figma and SCSS, these two tools I want to use in my project.
The main objective of this site is to demonstrate my understanding of these technologies.
I have chosen to use css grids over flexbox because that is an area I sometimes struggle with.


The Site Auto Seller is an online car dealership. It has the latest cars, with different car sectors: SUV, Sedan, etc.
I have made it user-friendly by keeping it up to standard with other car retailers, but I have also added my personal touch to give it my flair.
